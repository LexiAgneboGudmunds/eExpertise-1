As a complete beginner, you have no previous knowledge of computer and technology and have little to no understanding of computers in general.
You may have some knowledge about computers or technology but you don't know how hardware, software, graphic design or gaming works fully yet. This
option is great to start with as we will go through every detail we can and give sources on places for aquiring knowledge on your own.
</p>
<p>
As a beginner, you will get more thoroughly explained tips and we will teach you the basics of the subjects you picked before anything else.

<p>
by picking this you are still very new to the computer scene but have started learning about the computer niche you are intrested in, you may have
 started to research how to build a computer or maybe you have started a project, but you  do not have the experience or knowledge required
 to call yourself an expert.
</p>
<p>
We will tailor our product to you by still keeping the explainations thorough but we will go into more advanced things faster and not explain every
detail.

As a person who is familiar to computers and tech, you already have an amount of involvement in your hobby and you are looking to try more 
</p>
<p>
We will tailor your product by starting with advanced lessons and skip the basics. This means that if you picked hardware, for instance,
 you will be taught how to build a computer but rather how to overclock or how to do modify to your electronics to the likes of custom water
 cooling.

As someone who is adept, you have a large amount of knowledge and you feel comfortable in the knowledge you have and is able to teach 
others basics of your computer; it is very little you don't already know. 
</p>
<p>
We will tailor your content by only sending the most advanced lessons and tips. 
</p>
<p>
NOTE: we suggest you don't start with this skill group; there is probably much more to your niche that you do not know which would make 
this skill level confusing, but if you are truly confident in your knowledge, go ahead.
