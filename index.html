about us
</div>
<div id="p1" class="content-p">
We are CompuTailor, and our mission is to make the learning curve of the computer hobby less intimidating by giving 
detailed info about computer-related subjects and recommendations on digital products that we find helpful and beneficial to you.
<br>
</br>
Through endless hours of research and personal experience we have come to the conclusion that the biggest problem for
people looking to get into computers and technology is the large amount of required knowledge beforehand and
the fact that many don't know how to find the information they're looking for properly; a google search won't always help
as it can be missleading and may not be the answer your looking for because it isn't based of your perpective as a newcomer 
to computer tech.
<br>
</br>
Therefore we have created our course, tailor-made to your liking.

recieve daily computer tips and information personalized to your needs
</div>
<div id="p2" class="content-p">
To fix the problems almost everyone faces as a beginner we created a course that is both informative and understandable to all 
beginners, complete newcomers and those who are starting to get the hang of things alike. 
<br>
</br>
Everyone is unique, and so is everyone's preference for what they want in their hobbies, by using our free course you 
will learn about the things in computer tech that matter to you and we promise to never send you any spam or endless promotions
of products that mean nothing to you. if your prefer to learn about computer hardware and you're quite new to the subject you can
receive tutorials explaining the circuitry in motherboards or perhaps a detailed breakdown of chip-on-a-board computers and their
uses, the options are endless, all on a level that is the most informative and understandable without complicated technical jargon needed.
<br>
</br>
we're going to be upfront with you; we do have both affiliate products and promotions of our own products in our course, but 
they would not be there if they weren't strictly beneficial to you and we will not force to buy anything.
