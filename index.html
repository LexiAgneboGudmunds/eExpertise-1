about us
</h2>

<div id="p1" class="content-p">
<p>
We are e-Expertise, our mission is to provide you who wish to learn more about computers with helpful and interactive lessons and tutorials,
</p>
<p>
Through endless hours of research and personal experience we have come to the conclusion that the biggest problem for
people looking to get into computers and technology is the large amount of required knowledge beforehand and
the fact that many do not know where to find the information they are looking for; a google search won't always help
as it can be misleading and may not be the answer you are looking for.
</p>
<p>
Therefore we have created this dynamic and interactive course, tailor-made to your needs.
</p>

our solution
</h2>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="content-p">
<p>
To fix the problems that almost everyone face as a beginner, we have created a course that is both informative and easy to grasp for everyone,
 from complete newcomers to people who are already well-versed in computer technology. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone is unique, and so is everyone's preference for what they want to achive. By using our free class you 
will learn about the things in computer tech that matter to you and we promise to never send you any spam or promotions
for products that are of no interest to you.
</p>
<p>
If your prefer to learn about computer hardware, you can for example
order tutorials that explain the circuitry in motherboards or perhaps a detailed breakdown of chip-on-a-board computers and their
uses. The options are endless, all on an easy-to-grasp level, without complicated technical jargon.
</p>
<p>
We are going to be upfront with you; we do have affiliate products and promotions of our own products in our courses, but 
they would not be there if they were not beneficial to you and we will never force you to buy anything.
