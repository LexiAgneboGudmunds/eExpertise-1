<h3>Through personal experiences and intense research, we have collected the largest problems newcomers to computer hardware and software face. The main problem according to us is that people don't know where to look for the specific information they're after; they might be looking for tips on building a computer but are given a list of the best computer application for a new PC. Although we obviously cannot guarantee that you'll find our tips, reviews, and recommendations helpful, we are positive that the vast majority of our subscribers will find our information very useful.</h3>

<div class="a2 a">
<h3>At the end of every email sent by us, you will be able to give us feedback on the topic the email was about simply by pressing a button. The outcome is that if you liked the type of information the email was about, we will keep sending you those types of
emails, if not we will stop sending you that material and either try a different subject or more of the subjects you liked, it's that simple!</h3>

<h2>How do I know you won't simply send me endless promotions and spam?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a3 a">
<h3>We are going to be upfront with you; we do have promotions in our program, but most of our content is just tips, reviews or recommendations that we find helpful. We would not promote these products if they weren't strictly beneficial to you. We also promise to never send you spam, as there is nothing to gain from it and is disrespectful to our subscribers. </h3>
